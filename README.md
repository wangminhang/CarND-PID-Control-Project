## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## How to write a README
A well written README file can enhance your project and portfolio.  Develop your abilities to create professional README files by completing [this free course](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777).

## PID Components

The PID algorithm is composed of three components: P, I, and D. 

The "P" stands for proportional, which is used to steer the vehicle back to the center of the road in some proportion of the cross track error (CTE). 

The "I" stands for integral, and keeps a running sum of the CTE.
This is particularly useful for cars exhibiting some sort of steering bias, such as pulling to the right. 
In my implementation I found it helpful for going around turns, as the effects of the other components (P & D) were not compensating enough to stay in the middle of the lane during a sharp curve. 
Setting the "I" coefficient to a very small value  was enough to improve performance.

The "D" stands for derivative and it is used to prevent overcorrection from the "P" component. 
When the car is steering towards the center of the lane to adjust for the CTE, the derivative will become negative, so the "D" coefficient will reduce the absolute value of the steering angle produced by the "P" component, 
result in a smooth adjustment toward the center of the lane.

## Parameter Tuning

I adjust the PID coefficients through base on multiple trial. 
Starting by only set Kp to 0.2, result in a car that steered toward the center of the lane with drastically overshoot. 
Then reduce the Kp to 0.1 to reduce overcorrection for a certain extent. 
Then I introduce Kd and set it to 1, result in vastly performance improvement. 
Just using these two values was not enough to get the car around the track reasonably well, but the vehicle would go up on the curb during sharp turns. 
After a lot more turning with the Kp and Kd coefficients, I introduce the "I" component. 
I found that setting Ki to a small value of 0.002 could solve the sharp turnning problem. 

Testing by testing, I set the coefficient of [Kp,Ki,Kd] = [0.06,0.002,1.1], and get a better result.
